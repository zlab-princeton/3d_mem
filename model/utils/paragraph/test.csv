2e5c5396591c08c72a363684dd5539ea3d46c2c314f4cc67e3de4e75b68c7219,figurine,"The figure is a simplified 3D model with blocky, low-poly geometry. It has a boxy head, cylindrical torso, and limbs. All surfaces appear smooth and uniformly gray with no visible texture or material details. The arms are extended outward in all views, suggesting a welcoming or open posture. The background is completely black, isolating the object."
1b9af31b898c4a10fcfed2d7d09c6cf74ddb4231aa03484d043cf8de4b5d36db,sculpture,"The object is rendered as a smooth, solid gray silhouette with no visible texture or material details. It appears to be a 3D model with clean edges and a consistent matte finish. Four distinct views show the same object from different angles: one with legs extended, one standing upright, one in a dynamic running pose, and one in a leaping or kicking pose. The background is uniformly black, isolating the object. No environmental context or additional objects are visible."
f1ebad9974f141bc82ab5a9b10313a05,figurine,"Appears to be a solid, monolithic form with no visible seams or joints. Surfaces are smooth with subtle gradients suggesting lighting from one direction. The object has an asymmetrical, organic shape with a central hollow or indentation. No background context or material texture is visible."
422c52b7d3f8476b9950bf29189a1edd,figurine,"The figure is rendered in a smooth, matte gray material with no visible texture or surface detail. It has an elongated, somewhat distorted body with limbs extended in dynamic poses across the views. The head is small and featureless, and the overall geometry suggests a stylized or abstract representation of a human form. No background context is visible; the figure is isolated on a plain black background."
994d9b9971a2bf810ccc9661aae7aa5e13be655af2f1c2a5b8d936b66bc984ab,figurine,"Object has a rounded top section with two small protrusions on sides. Below is a tapered, multi-tiered cylindrical body. Surface appears smooth and matte gray. Geometry suggests it's a mechanical or industrial component. Background is unknown."
